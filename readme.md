## üìù Introduction

**Chanda Calculator (‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶¶‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶ü‡¶∞)** is a satirical single-page web application built with **React** and **Next.js**. This funny Bangla app is designed to poke fun at the political culture of "chanda" (forced donations or subscriptions) in Bangladesh.

Inspired by recent political discourse and accusations against parties like the BNP, this app provides a "professional" looking tool for citizens to "estimate" their mandatory contribution to the "cause". Users can select their profession, input their monthly income, and receive a humorously calculated chanda amount along with a witty, satirical justification. To complete the experience, they can even download a formal-looking "receipt" of their estimated contribution as a PDF.

This project is intended purely for **entertainment, humor, and political satire**. It is a commentary on political practices and should not be taken seriously.
